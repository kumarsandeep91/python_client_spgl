NOTES:

Changed structure of openFile and readEntirefile, the former no longer 
takes a stream instead it returns a file object since no empy file object
can be create. The latter simply returns a list instead of taking the list 
to add values into as an argument. Since a local vector in c++ would be 
destructed after the method close an argument passed by reference was
needed, however in Python the object would not be destructed, thus it makes
sense to simply return a new list.

Line 205 of gobjects.cpp fillFlag = true? shouldn't it be fillFlag = flag?

Line 680-683 of gobjects.cpp
should be bounds.getX + bounds.getWidth? same for y
also last line should be yMax = max( not yMin = min(
